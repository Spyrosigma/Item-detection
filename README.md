# Item-detection
In this repo, you can find ready to use item detection modules in which you use image, videos or webcam to detect items.
There are 3 working python files named :
## image_detection.py
## webcame_detection.py 
## video_detection.py 
...
And I've tried to make a frontend and merge it with my item-detection model using Flask. Check it out. It also contains the sample photos that I've run on my machine
# main.py
I'll try to complete it soon. 
THANKSSSSSSSSSSSSS !
